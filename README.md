# GovWifi Authentication API
# TEST #

This API is used by the frontend when a connection request is made to GovWifi.
Its function is to check these requests against user details and the result determines how FreeRADIUS reacts to it e.g. allow / dissallow the connection.

N.B. The private GovWifi [build repository][build-repo] contains instructions on how to build GovWifi end-to-end - the sites, services and infrastructure.

## Overview

GovWifi exposes FreeRADIUS servers on public IP addresses, which are configured
to communicate with this private API via its REST plugin.

### Sinatra routes

* `GET /authorize/user/:user_name`  - FreeRADIUS authorisation route

### Dependencies

* MySQL database - user details generated by the [user signup API][user-signup-api]
  are fetched by this API.

## Developing

The [Makefile][makefile] contains commonly used commands for working with this app:

* `make test` runs all the automated tests.
* `make serve` starts the API server on localhost.
* `make shell` starts the API server, then opens a shell in its docker container.

### Deploying changes

Merging to `master` will automatically deploy this API to staging.
To deploy to production, choose _Deploy to production_ in the Concourse Pipeline.

## Gotchas

### Extra API parameters

```ruby
let(:url) { "/authorize/user/#{username}/mac/#{client_mac}/ap/#{ap_mac}/site/#{ap_ip_address}/apg/#{ap_aruba_name}/mdn/#{ap_meraki_name}" }
```

Currently we do not use any of the above parameters after username
within any part of the API code. However having these parameters in the
CloudWatch logs is useful for linking up matching requests between the
/authorize and /post-auth calls while debugging.
